# iheart
This exercise is to demo casestudy for iheart.
I have implemented a front controller with mvc design pattern. The action parameter dictates how different things happen in the app.
I have simple todo_items table where i store any todo created by the user. it also has a completed flag which indicates that status of whether it was completed or not. I have simulated a logged in user by hardcoding user id 1. The user tables / login / registartion were out of scope for this exercise. so the user part has been simulated by hardcoding. 

Let me know if you have any questions.
